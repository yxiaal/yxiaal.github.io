Here are the notes that I take in class or after class, written on iPad with iPad Pencil.

- [Tensor Calulus](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/Notes on Tensor Analysis 2020年2月24日.pdf) , an evolving short notes on basics of tensors based on Lecture Notes on Diff. Geo. by Prof Peter Petersen, Lecture notes on Diff. Mnflds. & Rie. Geo. by Prof Fong Tsz Ho, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGXr1SF3WmA&list=PLJHszsWbB6hpk5h8lSfBkVrpjsqvUGTCx) on tensor calculus.
- [Surfaces theory in $R^3$ A](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/Theory of Surfaces in R3 1.pdf) and [Surfaces theory in $R^3$ B](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/Theory of Surfaces in R3 2.pdf). These notes are about classical differential geometry, based on my review notes of MATH 120A UCLA. References are Lecture Notes on Diff. Geo. by Prof Peter Petersen, Lecture notes on Diff. Mnflds. & Rie. Geo. by Prof Fong Tsz Ho, [ICTP's video on Diff. Geo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKnBj7B2PSg&list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz) and Elementary Diff. Geo. by Andrew Pressley.
- Real analysis. These are notes I took down in MATH 5011 Advanced Analysis at HKUST in Fall 2019. It covers [Lebesgue Integration theory](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/积分理论 .pdf), [$L^p$ spaces](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/L^p Spaces 2019.9.25.pdf),  [Lebesgue Diff. Thm](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/Lebesgue Differentiation.pdf). and [Fubini Thm](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/(Finite) Product measure and Fubini Thm.pdf). [Egorov, Luzin Thm and basics of Hausdorff measure](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/Egorov, Lusin and Hausdorff.pdf) at the level of Year 1 Graduate course.
- An incomplete elementary notes on [differential manifolds](yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/TangentCotangentBundleLieDerivativeDifferentialForms.pdf). It covers tangent & cotangent bundle, differential forms and Lie derivatives.
