Here are the notes that I take in class or after class, written on iPad with iPad Pencil.

- [Tensor Calulus](https://yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/NotesonTensorAnalysis.pdf) , an evolving short notes on basics of tensors based on Lecture Notes on Diff. Geo. by Prof Peter Petersen, Lecture notes on Diff. Mnflds. & Rie. Geo. by Prof Fong Tsz Ho, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGXr1SF3WmA&list=PLJHszsWbB6hpk5h8lSfBkVrpjsqvUGTCx) on tensor calculus.
- [Surfaces theory in $R^3$ A](https://yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/TheoryofSurfacesinR3A.pdf) and [Surfaces theory in $R^3$ B](https://yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/TheoryofSurfacesinR3B.pdf). These notes are about classical differential geometry, based on my review notes of MATH 120A UCLA. References are Lecture Notes on Diff. Geo. by Prof Peter Petersen, Lecture notes on Diff. Mnflds. & Rie. Geo. by Prof Fong Tsz Ho, [ICTP's video on Diff. Geo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKnBj7B2PSg&list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz) and Elementary Diff. Geo. by Andrew Pressley.
- Real analysis. These are notes I took down in MATH 5011 Advanced Analysis at HKUST in Fall 2019. It covers [Lebesgue Integration theory](https://yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/IntegralTheory.pdf), [$L^p$ spaces](https://yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/L^pSpaces20190925.pdf),  [Lebesgue Diff. Thm](https://yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/LebesgueDifferentiation.pdf). and [Fubini Thm](https://yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/FiniteProductmeasureandFubiniThm.pdf). [Egorov, Luzin Thm and basics of Hausdorff measure](https://yxiaal.github.io/pdfs/EgorovLusinandHausdorff.pdf) at the level of Year 1 Graduate course.
