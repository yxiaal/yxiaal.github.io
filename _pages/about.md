This is Yusen XIA's homepage.
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics-Pure math advanced track at Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST). I was an exchange student at UCLA from Winter 2020 to Spring 2020. In Summer 2020 I read Hamilton's classic 3-Manifolds with Positive Ricci Curvature under the guidence of Prof Frederick Fong.
Recently I'm focusing on rotationally symmetric self-expanders of Mean Curvature Flow.
