This is Yusen XIA's homepage.
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics-Pure math advanced track at Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST). Currently I'm an exchange student at UCLA from Winter 2020 to Spring 2020.
Recently I'm focusing on Classical Differential Geometry and Riemannian Geometry.
